SpellChecker: A basic spell checker implemented using a hash table (HashSet) to efficiently detect misspelled words and generate spelling suggestions based on edit operations. This program reads a dictionary file (e.g., words.txt) and uses it to check spelling in an input text file. Words not found in the dictionary are reported as incorrect, and the program can generate suggestions using simple spelling correction techniques.
